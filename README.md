# Playing Cards Webpage

This project is a simple webpage that displays a set of playing cards using **HTML** and **CSS**. The cards are arranged using **flexbox**, and each card has its own visual structure. The page follows the layout of cards with specific character symbols, including ♠, ♥, and ♦, and is designed to be responsive.

## Project Overview

This webpage displays a set of at least three playing cards. Each card has three distinct sections:

* **Left**: Displays a suit character (♠, ♥, ♦).
* **Middle**: Displays a card number or letter (Ace, King, 10) along with the suit character.
* **Right**: Displays the same suit character as the left.

The layout is done using **flexbox** to ensure that the cards are centered and spaced properly across different screen sizes. The design is simple yet modern, with some subtle styling elements like borders, shadows, and padding.

## User Stories

The project fulfills the following user stories:

1. **Main Element**: The page contains a `main` element with an ID of `playing-cards`.
2. **Card Elements**: At least three `div` elements with a class of `card` are present within the `#playing-cards` element.
3. **Card Div Structure**: Each `.card` element contains exactly three child `div` elements: `.left`, `.middle`, and `.right`.
4. **Flexbox Layout**:

   * The `#playing-cards` container uses flexbox to center the cards horizontally, allows wrapping, and provides a 20px gap between them.
   * Each `.card` uses flexbox to space its children.
   * The `.left` element is aligned to the start, `.middle` is centered, and `.right` is aligned to the end.
   * The `.middle` element uses flexbox to arrange its children in a column.

## How to Run the Project

## Acknowledgements

* **Flexbox**: The layout techniques used for arranging the cards rely heavily on flexbox for responsiveness and alignment. If you're unfamiliar with flexbox, the [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is a great resource.
* The suit characters ♠, ♥, ♦, and ♣ were used as visual elements for the playing cards.
